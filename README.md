## Introduction
I have been asked to write a app for a friend. His company brings the worlds finest avocados from Mexico to London. He supplies restaurants and retailers. Currently his clients order vi text, WhatsApp, email and voicemail. 
Delivery days are Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
On the morning of delivery day my friend and the driver meet at the warehouse. My friend provides a list of clients and their requirements that he has generated from the various communication methods and they load the van.

## User Stories
My friend would like  a single ordering system that all of the clients could use
He would also like this system to generate a list of orders based on delivery date
